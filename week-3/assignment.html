            <h2>How To Make Images Larger without losing Quality:</h2>
            <p>
                Making an image larger usually means lower quality.
                At least that’s how it was in the past. With advancements in AI and upscaling technology,however,
                we’re seeing image enlargers and upscalers that maintain the original quality of an image – or even improve it.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may want to enlarge an image for a print-quality poster, 
                or perhaps you’re looking to enlarge and enhance a blurry old image of your family. 
                Thankfully, there are specialized tools that help you easily enlarge and enhance images
                 without the pixelation issues you’d normally get if you tried to increase an image’s dimensions using a conventional editing tool.
